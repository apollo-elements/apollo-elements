Apollo Elements helps you build full-scale, high-performance GraphQL frontends with state-of-the-art web technologies. Use your favourite web components base library like [lit](../api/libraries/lit-apollo/) or [FAST](../api/libraries/fast/); or write your components with [vanilla JS](../api/libraries/mixins/). If you're starting from scratch, use the app generator to bootstrap a project.

<code-tabs collection="package-managers" default-tab="npm">

```bash tab npm
npm init @apollo-elements
```

```bash tab yarn
npm init @apollo-elements -- app --pkg-manager yarn
```

```bash tab pnpm
pnpm init @apollo-elements
```

</code-tabs>

Read the [getting started](./getting-started/) guide for a more detailed breakdown of how to set up your projects, including an introduction to GraphQL, the Apollo Client, [buildless development](./getting-started/buildless-development/) workflows, and [production optimizations](./getting-started/building-for-production/). When you're ready to start building your app component, the [usage](./usage/) guide shows you how to write, [query](./usage/queries/), [mutation](./usage/mutations/), and [subscription](./usage/subscriptions/) components, and how to manage [local state](./usage/local-state/).

Learn about advanced techniques like [operation variable validation](./cool-tricks/validating-variables/) and [code splitting](./cool-tricks/code-splitting/) in the [cool tricks](./cool-tricks/) section. Use our [pre-made components](../api/components/) to streamline your workflow. Dive into the [API documentation](../api/) for details on how each component class works.
