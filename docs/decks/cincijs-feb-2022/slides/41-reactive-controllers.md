## What are _Reactive_ _Controllers_?

A new 'composition primitive' for web components, developed by the Lit team @ Google

Not limited to LitElement, can work with any component system even React, Angular, etc.

Complements or replaces class inheritance and mixins

<dl>
  <dt>Mixins / Inheritance</dt> <dd>x "is a" y</dd>
  <dt>Controllers</dt>          <dd>x "has a" y</dd>
</dl>
