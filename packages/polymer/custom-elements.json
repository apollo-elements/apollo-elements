A query will still have this network status even if a result was returned from the cache, but a query was dispatched anyway.\n2. `setVariables`: If a queryâ€™s variables change and a network request was fired then the network status will be setVariables until the result of that query comes back. React users will see this when options.variables changes on their queries.\n3. `fetchMore`: Indicates that fetchMore was called on this query and that the network request created is currently in flight.\n4. `refetch`: It means that refetch was called on a query and the refetch request is currently in flight.\n5. Unused.\n6. `poll`: Indicates that a polling query is currently in flight. So for example if you are polling a query every 10 seconds then the network status will switch to poll every 10 seconds whenever a poll request has been sent but not resolved.\n7. `ready`: No request is in flight for this query, and no errors happened. Everything is OK.\n8. `error`: No request is in flight for this query, but one or more errors were detected.\n\nIf the network status is less then 7 then it is equivalent to `loading` being true. In fact you could\nreplace all of your `loading` checks with `networkStatus < 7` and you would not see a difference.\nIt is recommended that you use `loading`, however.",
