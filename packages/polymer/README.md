## 🔧 Installation
`apollo-elements` are distributed through `npm` the node package manager. To install a copy of the latest version of these elements in your project's `node_modules` directory, first [Install npm on your system](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), then run the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
npm install --save @apollo-elements/polymer
```

`@apollo-elements/polymer` does not depend on `@polymer/polymer`. The components extend directly from HTMLElement, so they're suitable for use in any project, not just [Polymer library](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/) apps.

## 👩‍🚀 Usage
> See our [docs on setting up Apollo client](https://apolloelements.dev/pages/guides/getting-started/apollo-client.html) so your components can fetch their data.

Just import the elements.

<code-copy>

```js
import '@apollo-elements/polymer/apollo-query';
import '@apollo-elements/polymer/apollo-mutation';
```

</code-copy>

You can now use them in your polymer template:

<code-copy>

```html
<apollo-query data="{{data}}" variables="[[variables]]">
  <script type="application/graphql">
    query User($id: ID!)
      user(id: $id) {
        name
        picture
      }
    }
  </script>
</apollo-query>

<paper-icon-item>
  <iron-image slot="item-icon">[[data.user.picture]]</iron-image>
  [[data.user.name]]
</paper-icon-item>
```

</code-copy>
