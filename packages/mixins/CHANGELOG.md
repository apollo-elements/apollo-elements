### Major Changes

- b5f2502f: Makes GraphQL script children opt-in

  Removes the ability to read GraphQL documents (i.e. `query`, `mutation`, or `subscription`) and variables from the DOM via `<script type="application/graphql">` or json.

  You can opt-back in to this behaviour by applying the `GraphQLScriptChildMixin` from `@apollo-elements/mixins`.

  `<apollo-*>` components all still have this facility. Be careful when accepting user-generated HTML, as it means users can make arbitrary queries by adding HTML to the document.

  Read [the docs](https://apolloelements.dev/api/libraries/mixins/graphql-script-child-mixin/) for more info

  Deprecates `@apollo-elements/lib` and `@apollo-elements/interfaces`

  Removes the `lib` and `interfaces` packages, and moves their contents to `core`.

  If you were for some reason importing these, update your imports.

### Patch Changes

- 0ccd5682: Removes unused "private" properties `__options` and `__networkStatus` from the apollo-query-mixin class
