# @apollo-elements/hybrids

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- fed2e0c6: Upgrades hybrids dependency to version 5.3.3 and use `ApolloController`

  Now, `query`, `mutation`, and `subscription` factories use `ApolloController` under the hood. This removes the need to hack into hybrids' reactivity system, deletes bad prototype hacking, and decreseases bundle sizes.

  We also removed the `client` factory. Instead, pass a `client` instance in to the factory's options (or don't, to fallback to the default `window.__APOLLO_CLIENT__`).

  #### Before:

  ```js
  define("my-query", {
    client: client(someClient),
    query: query(MyQuery)
  });
  ```

  #### After:

  ```js
  define("my-query", {
    query: query(MyQuery, { client: someClient })
  });
  ```

- 4cb497a4: Makes GraphQL script children opt-in

  Removes the ability to read GraphQL documents (i.e. `query`, `mutation`, or `subscription`) and variables from the DOM via `<script type="application/graphql">` or json.

  You can opt-back in to this behaviour by applying the `GraphQLScriptChildMixin` from `@apollo-elements/mixins`.

  `<apollo-*>` components and the Polymer components all still have this facility. Be careful when accepting user-generated HTML, as it means users can make arbitrary queries by adding HTML to the document.

  Read [the docs](https://apolloelements.dev/api/libraries/mixins/graphql-script-child-mixin/) for more info

  Deprecates `@apollo-elements/lib` and `@apollo-elements/interfaces`

  Removes the `lib` and `interfaces` packages, and moves their contents to `core`.

  If you were for some reason importing these, update your imports.

### Minor Changes

- ea45702b: Adds `optionsChanged` callback. This protected, optional callback allows for setting the `options` property on an ApolloQueryController to set options on the internal `ObservableQuery`. Use it by setting the options property. Setting internal properties will not initiate side effects.

  ```js
  class QueryElement extends ReactiveElement {
    query = new ApolloQueryController(this, SomeQuery);
  }

  const el = new QueryElement();
  el.query.options = { refetchWritePolicy: "merge" }; // will trigger `setOptions`
  el.query.options.refetchWritePolicy = "merge"; // will *not* trigger `setOptions`
  ```
