   * 1. `loading`: The query has never been run before and the request is now pending. A query will still have this network status even if a result was returned from the cache, but a query was dispatched anyway.
   * 2. `setVariables`: If a query’s variables change and a network request was fired then the network status will be setVariables until the result of that query comes back. React users will see this when options.variables changes on their queries.
   * 3. `fetchMore`: Indicates that fetchMore was called on this query and that the network request created is currently in flight.
   * 4. `refetch`: It means that refetch was called on a query and the refetch request is currently in flight.

   * 7. `ready`: No request is in flight for this query, and no errors happened. Everything is OK.
   * 8. `error`: No request is in flight for this query, but one or more errors were detected.
   *
   * If the network status is less then 7 then it is equivalent to `loading` being true. In fact you could
