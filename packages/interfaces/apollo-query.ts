   * `networkStatus` is useful if you want to display a different loading indicator (or no indicator at all)

   * on your component than `loading` does. `networkStatus` is an enum with different number values between 1 and 8.
   * These number values each represent a different network state.
   *
   * 1. `loading`: The query has never been run before and the request is now pending. A query will still have this network status even if a result was returned from the cache, but a query was dispatched anyway.
   * 2. `setVariables`: If a queryâ€™s variables change and a network request was fired then the network status will be setVariables until the result of that query comes back. React users will see this when options.variables changes on their queries.
   * 3. `fetchMore`: Indicates that fetchMore was called on this query and that the network request created is currently in flight.
   * 4. `refetch`: It means that refetch was called on a query and the refetch request is currently in flight.
   * 5. Unused.
   * 6. `poll`: Indicates that a polling query is currently in flight. So for example if you are polling a query every 10 seconds then the network status will switch to poll every 10 seconds whenever a poll request has been sent but not resolved.
   * 7. `ready`: No request is in flight for this query, and no errors happened. Everything is OK.
   * 8. `error`: No request is in flight for this query, but one or more errors were detected.
   *
   * If the network status is less then 7 then it is equivalent to `loading` being true. In fact you could
   * replace all of your `loading` checks with `networkStatus < 7` and you would not see a difference.
   * It is recommended that you use `loading`, however.
