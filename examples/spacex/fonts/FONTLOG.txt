Basic Font Information

DIN 1451 is a sans-serif typeface that is widely used for traffic,
administrative and technical applications. It was defined by the German
standards body DIN - Deutsches Institut fur Normung (German Institute for
Standardization) in the standard sheet DIN 1451-Schriften (typefaces) in
1931. Similar standards existed for stencilled letters.

Originally designed for industrial uses, the first DIN-type fonts were a
simplified design that could be applied with limited technical difficulty.
Due to the design's legibility and uncomplicated, unadorned design, it has
become popular for general purpose use in signage and display adaptations.
Many adaptations and expansions of the original design have been released
digitally.

OFL v1.1 license.

D-DIN currently provides the following Unicode coverage:
Basic Latin: complete
